# Using a Color Tokens export from Sketch

With the Color Tokens feature in Sketch, you can take Color Variables in a Sketch document, like this:

![example of Sketch Library](sketch-file-example.png)

And bring them into a project like this:

Please see our documentation for more information on [how to create Color Variables in Sketch](#) and [how to export Color Tokens](#).

## Installation instructions

You will need [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) or [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) to run this project. You will also need to rename the `SAMPLE_tokensURL.json` file in the project to `tokens.json` and add your Color Tokens URL there.

Before starting the project, you'll need to install the dependencies with either of these commands:

- `yarn`
- `npm i`

To start the project in development mode:

- `yarn start`
- `npm run start`

And to build for production mode:

- `yarn build`
- `npm run build`

This project features React with Webpack and Styled Components, using Javascript.

## Importing your Color Tokens into a file

Hereâ€™s a quick example on how you can use a Color Tokens export from Sketch with your project.

After you activate a public Color Tokens URL from a Sketch document in the web app, you can add it to a `tokensURL.json` file at the root of your project, in the following format:

```
{"url": "<YOUR_URL_HERE>"}
```

The `start` and `build` scripts mentioned above will generate a `theme/colors.json` file with your Color Tokens. The code doing this is the following, found on the file [getColors.js](getColors.js):

```
const fs = require('fs');
const https = require('https');
const tokensUrl = require('./tokensUrl.json');

const file = fs.createWriteStream('./src/theme/colors.json');

https.get(tokensUrl.url, (response) => {
 const stream = response.pipe(file);

 stream.on('finish', function () {
  console.log('colors imported');
 });
});

```

## Using the tokens in your project

We're providing an example React + Styled Components app that uses Color Tokens from the exported file. To do this on your project, you simply import your tokens file where you need it.

In our case, we have two colour groups on our tokens file: `Buttons` and `ColorList`. These two are explored on the [ColorList.jsx](/src/components/ColorList.jsx) and [Buttons.jsx](/src/components/Buttons.jsx) files, providing you different examples on how to access the token values.

On the [`Buttons`](/src/components/Buttons.jsx), we're providing the colour file to the `ThemeProvider` of `styled-components`, so we can directly use the tokens on the components:

```
const GreenButton = styled(BaseButton)`
 background: ${({ theme }) => theme.Fill['Offset'].value};
`;
```

On [`ColorList`](/src/components/ColorList.jsx), we're listing all the colours, without providing a theme:

```
<CategoryColorItem
    key={index}
    colorValue={theme.Category[colorName].value}
    >
    {colorName}
</CategoryColorItem>
```
